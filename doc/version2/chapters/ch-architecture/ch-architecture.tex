\chapter{GSN Architecture}

%\gsn is composed of three parts: data acquisition, data processing, and output
%dispatching (also called notification subsystem).


%\section{System architecture}
\label{sec:system-architecture}

GSN uses a container-based architecture for hosting virtual sensors.
Similar to application servers, GSN provides an environment in which
sensor networks can easily and flexibly be specified and deployed by
hiding most of the system complexity in the GSN Server.  Using the
declarative specifications, virtual sensors can be deployed and
reconfigured in GSN Servers at runtime. Communication and
processing among different GSN Servers is performed in a
peer-to-peer style through standard Internet and Web Services protocols. By
viewing GSN Servers as cooperating peers in a decentralized system,
we tried avoid some of the intrinsic scalability problems of many
other systems which rely on a centralized or hierarchical
architecture. Targeting a ``Sensor Internet'' as the long-term goal we
also need to take into account that such a system will consist of
``Autonomous Sensor Systems'' with a large degree of freedom and only
limited possibilities of control, similarly as in the Internet.

Figure~\ref{fig:NodeArchitecture} shows the layered architecture of a
GSN Server.

\begin{figure}%[htb]

  \caption{GSN Server architecture}
  \label{fig:NodeArchitecture}
\end{figure}

Each GSN server hosts a number of virtual sensors it is responsible
for. The virtual sensor manager (VSM) is responsible for providing
access to the virtual sensors, managing the delivery of sensor data,
and providing the necessary administrative infrastructure. The VSM has
two subcomponents: The life-cycle manager (LCM) provides and manages
the resources provided to a virtual sensor and manages the
interactions with a virtual sensor (sensor readings, etc.). The input
stream manager (ISM) is responsible for managing the streams,
allocating resources to them, and enabling resource sharing among them
while its stream quality manager subcomponent (SQM) handles sensor
disconnections, missing values, unexpected delays, etc., thus ensuring
the QoS of streams. All data from/to the VSM passes through the
storage layer which is in charge of providing and managing persistent
storage for data streams. Query processing in turn relies on all of
the above layers and is done by the query manager (QM) which includes
the query processor being in charge of SQL parsing, query planning,
and execution of queries (using an adaptive query execution plan). The
query repository manages all registered queries (subscriptions) and
defines and maintains the set of currently active queries for the
query processor.  The notification manager deals with the delivery of
events and query results to registered, local or remote virtual sensors. The
notification manager has an extensible architecture which allows the
user to largely customize its functionality, for example, having
results mailed or being notified via SMS.

The top three layers of the architecture deal with access to the GSN
server. The interface layer provides access functions for other GSN
servers and via the Web (through a browser or via web services).
These functionalities are protected and shielded by the access control
layer providing access only to entitled parties and the data integrity
layer which provides data integrity and confidentiality through
electronic signatures and encryption. Data access and data integrity
can be defined at different levels, for example, for the whole GSN
server or at a virtual sensor level.

In connection with RFID tags this ``plug-and-play'' feature of GSN
provides new and interesting types of mobility which we will
investigate in future work. For example, an RFID tag may store queries
which are executed as soon as the tag is detected by a reader, thus
transforming RFID tags from simple means for identification and
description into a GSN server for physically mobile queries which opens
up new and interesting possibilities for mobile information systems.

%\section{Self Identifying Devices}
%An interesting feature of GSN's architecture is the support for sensor
%mobility based on automatic detection of sensors and zero-programing
%deployment: A large number of sensors already support the IEEE 1451
%standard which describes a sensor's properties and measurement
%characteristics such as type of measurement, scaling, and calibration
%information in a so-called Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS)
%which is stored inside the sensor. When a new sensor node is detected
%by GSN, for example, by moving into the transmission range of a sink
%node, GSN requests its TEDS and uses the contained information for the
%dynamic generation of a virtual sensor description by using a virtual
%sensor description template and deriving the sensor-specific fields
%of the template from the data extracted from the TEDS. At the moment
%TEDS provides only that information about a sensor which enables
%interaction with it.  Thus for some parts of the generated virtual
%sensor description, e.g., security requirements, storage and resource
%management, etc., we use default values. Then GSN dynamically
%instantiates the new virtual sensor based on this synthesized
%description and all local and remote processing dependent on the new
%sensor is executed. This is done on-the-fly while GSN is running. The
%inverse process is performed if a sensor is no longer associated with
%a GSN node, e.g., it has moved away.


\section{Data Acquisition}

Before filtering and processing data, \gsn needs to receive it. \gsn considers two types of data sources: event-based and polling-based.
In the first case, data is sent by the source and a \gsn method is called when it arrives.
Serial ports, network (TCP or UDP) connections, wireless webcams fall in this case. In the latter one, GSN periodically asks the 
source for new data. This is the case of an RSS feed or a POP3 email account.

\subsection{\gsn Wrappers \label{gsn_wrappers}}

\gsn can receive data from various data sources. This is done by using so called
wrappers. They are used to encapsulate the data received from the data source
into the standard GSN data model, called a StreamElement. A StreamElement
is an object representing a row of a SQL table.
Each wrapper is a Java class that extends the AbstractWrapper parent class.
Usually a wrapper initializes a specialized third-party library in its constructor.
It also provides a method which is called each time the library receives data from
the monitored device. This method will extract the interesting data, optionally
parse it, and create one or more StreamElement(s) with one or more columns.
From this point on, the received data has been mapped to a SQL data structure
with fields that have a name and a type. \gsn is then able to filter this using
its enhanced SQL-like syntax. You will learn more about that in section \todo{TODO: Add proper reference}
A wrapper is implemented in a Java class. For simplicity, \gsn uses short
names to refer to these wrappers. These associations are defined in the file
conf/wrappers.properties. For now on it is assumed that you use the default
names provided at installation time.

The standard \gsn wrappers are documented in Appendix \ref{sec:quickref_wrappers}.

The development of \gsn wrappers is described in Appendix \ref{sec:developer-guide_wrappers}.

\subsection{Safe Storage \label{safe_storage}}

Some acquisition systems do not internally store the data produced until GSN can process it. For instance 
the TinyOS Serial Forwarder simply sends a copy of the incoming messages to all its alive listeners. If GSN is down 
at that time, the data produced will be lost. Safe Storage is specialy developed to handle that case.
Safe Storage runs in a separate process and it aims is to simply store persistently the incoming data until the GSN process can ask for them.

These two processes communicate together upon TCP sockets and could run on different machines. The Safe Storage process acts as 
a server and GSN processes as clients. This communication and the primary storage increase the delay between the data production and the 
final storage into GSN. This results in a tradeoff between the performances and the reliability.
Moreover, GSN can run both standard wrappers and Safe Storage wrappers at the same time.

\subsubsection{Software Architecture}

Safe Storage is generic and could be added to all the already existing wrappers.
However small modifications need to be done since the Safe Storage wrappers are split into the two following parts

\begin{itemize}
	\item The acquisition part that runs in the Safe Storage process
	\item The processing part that runs in the GSN process
\end{itemize}

The wrapper class that executes on the Safe Storage should be kept as simple as possible and must extend the
\inlinecode{gsn.acquisition2.wrappers.AbstractWrapper2} abstract class.
An implementation of this class must define the methods shown on the \listingref{listing:java:safestorage_methods_to_implement}.

\begin{javacode}[caption={Methods to implement for a Safe Storage Wrapper - Safe Storage Side}, label=listing:java:safestorage_methods_to_implement]
public abstract boolean initialize ()
public abstract void finalize ()
public abstract String getWrapperName () 
public abstract void run()
\end{javacode}

The class that executes on the GSN side should do the data processing and must extend the 
\inlinecode{gsn.acquisition2.wrappers.SafeStorageAbstractWrapper} abstract class.
An implementation of this class must define the methods shown on the \listingref{listing:java:safestorage_gsn_methods_to_implement}

\begin{javacode}[caption={Methods to implement for a Safe Storage Wrapper - GSN Side}, label=listing:java:safestorage_gsn_methods_to_implement]
public DataField[] getOutputFormat()
public boolean messageToBeProcessed(DataMsg dataMessage)
\end{javacode}

\subsubsection{Safe Storage configuration}

All the wrappers that are based on Safe Storage must set the list of parameters defined in \listingref{table:arch_safe_storage_parameters}.
The Safe Storage and Safe Storage controller port are defined in the \inlinecode{build.xml} file.

\begin{xmlcode}[caption={Safe Storage ports}, label=listing:xml:safestorage_ports]
   <property name="safe-storage-port" value="25000"/>
   <property name="safe-storage-controller-port" value="25012"/>
\end{xmlcode}

The \listingref{listing:xml:safestorage_vsd} shows an example of a \vsd that uses a Safe Storage \wrapper.

</virtual-sensor>
\end{xmlcode}

\subsection{Safe Storage Wrappers Default parameters}

The parameters shown on the \listingref{table:arch_safe_storage_parameters} must be added to each \wrapper that support the 
Safe Storage feature. An example of \wrapper that use this feature is described in \chapref{tinyos-mig:wrapper}.

\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Use Cases}

When a virtual sensor that use a Safe Storage \wrapper is loaded into GSN,
a request is made to Safe Storage for the \wrapper. If the \wrapper is not already
created\footnote{In the current implementation, a Safe Storage \wrapper is identified by the following information:\newline{}
\inlinecode{<virtual-sensor-name>/<source-name>/<safe-storage-wrapper-short-name>}} 
this will create, initialize and run a new instance of the \wrapper in the Safe Storage process.
If the \wrapper was already running, it will be reused.

If the GSN process fails or is shut down, The Safe Storage \wrapper will continue to acquire the data. Once the GSN process is
restarted, all the data will be fetched from the Safe Storage DB.

If the Safe Storage process fails or is shut down, the data are not stored anymore and the GSN process will try periodically to 
connect to the Safe Storage process until the latter has been restarted.
When you restart the Safe Storage process, it will automatically create and start acquiring data for the wrappers that were loaded before.

\subsection{Safe Storage in Nutshell}

In order to coordinate the activities between the GSN and Safe Storage(SS), a custom protocol has defined. The GSN \textless-\textgreater SS protocol 
constitutes of the following messages:
\begin{description}
	\item[HelloMessage\footnote{Implemented by \texttt{gsn.acquisition2.messages.HelloMsg} class.}] is the first message sent from GSN to SS in order to represent the request to use a wrapper at the SS. In order to SS to instantiate the wrapper, SS has to know the following
	information about the requested wrapper:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{wrapper's initialization parameters}, these are the original wrapper initialization parameters (exactly as they are specified in the virtual sensor file) sent from the GSN server to the SS. 
		\item \texttt{requester} or \emph{unique wrapper identifier} is a string which uniquely identifies the wrapper at the safe storage. As one safe storage component can be used to host multiple wrappers at the same time, SS has to create internal mapping between every request
		and the cooresponding wrapper at the SS. The mapping is used by the reconnection requests from the GSN (in the case of network disconnectivity or GSN crash) in order to resume the sensor data feed toward the GSN server.
		\item \texttt{continue-on-error} Which is a boolean ...
	\end{itemize}
	Once the HelloMessage received by the SS, SS stores the original HelloMessage into its internal storage. The reason behind this to 
	make sure SafeStorage as all the necessary information when its gets started. Whenever Safe Storage gets restarted, it resume the
	data acquisition process for all its previously active wrappers (without receiving HelloMessages).
\end{description}

\section{Data Filtering and Processing}

GSN provides two complementary mechanisms to work on data.
The first one is based on a SQL syntax enhanced with specialized semantics
for timed sliding windows and event counting.
The second one allows to manipulate data with specialized programs called
virtual sensors. GSN comes with a library of virtual sensors that you can use
without programming. 

GSN always processes the data according to a virtual sensor configuration.
If you only want to use the SQL filtering mechanism, without any data trans-
formation, you can use the BridgeVirtualSensor (see \ref{bridge:vsp}).
If you have more sophisticated needs, you can write your
own virtual sensor processing class (See appendix \ref{sec:vsp}).  If you don't want to use the SQL filtering mechanism, simply select all data
from the wrapper.

\subsection{Virtual Sensors}

%\section{Virtual sensors}
\label{sec:virt-sens-spec}


The key abstraction in GSN is the \textit{virtual sensor}. Virtual
sensors abstract from the implementation details of the data aource to sensor data
and correspond either to a data stream received directly from sensors
or to a data stream derived from other virtual sensors. A virtual
sensor can be any kind of data producer, for example, a real sensor, a
wireless camera, a desktop computer, or any combination of virtual sensors.
A virtual sensor may have any number of input data
streams and produces exactly one output data stream (with predefined format) based on the input
data streams and arbitrary local processing. The specification of a
virtual sensor provides all necessary information required for
deploying and using it, including (1) metadata used for identification
and discovery, (2) the details of the data streams which the virtual
sensor consumes and produces (3) an SQL-based specification of the
stream processing (filtering and integration) performed in a virtual sensor, (4)
the processing class which performs the more advanced and complex data processing (if needed) on the output
stream before releasing it and (5) functional properties related to persistency, error handling, life-cycle,
management, and physical deployment.

To support rapid deployment, the virtual sensors are provided
in human readable declarative forms (XML). Figure~\ref{fig:ComplexVS} shows an
example which defines a virtual sensor that reads two temperature sensors and
in case both of them have the same reading above a certain threshold in the
last minute, the virtual sensor returns the latest picture from the webcam in
the same room together with the measured temperature.

%  \caption{A virtual sensor definition}
%  \label{fig:ComplexVS}}
%\end{figure}

A virtual sensor has a unique name (the \verb|name| attribute in line 1) and
can be equipped with a set of key-value pairs representing the logical addressing of the
virtual sensor (lines 12--17), i.e., associated with metadata. The addressing information can be registered and
discovered in GSN and other virtual sensors can use either the unique name or
logical addressing based on the metadata to refer to a virtual sensor. 
We have defined certain addressing keys which are specifically used by the GSN's web interface. In GSN if a given
virtual sensor has the addressing values for the both \texttt{latitude} (line 15) and \texttt{longitude} (line 16) keys, the default GSN
web interface uses these geographical locations to show the sensor on the global map.

The example specification above defines a virtual sensor with three input streams
which are identified by their metadata\footnote{Note that the support for distributed directory/registry service had been removed
from GSN's source code thus as of \today, we only support physical addressing for identifying the data sources.},
i.e., by logical addressing. For example, the first temperature sensor is
addressed by specifying two requirements on its metadata, namely
that it is of type temperature sensor and at a certain physical certain
location. By using multiple input streams Figure \ref{fig:ComplexVS} also
demonstrates GSN's ability to access multiple stream producers simultaneously.
For the moment, we assume that the input streams (two temperature sensors and a
webcam) have already been defined in other virtual sensor definitions (how this
is done, will be described below).

In GSN, data streams are temporal sequences of timestamped tuples (also known as \texttt{Stream Elements}).
This is in line with the model used in most stream processing systems. The structure of
the output data stream a virtual sensor produces is encoded in XML as shown in lines 6 -- 9 (the \texttt{output-structure} part).
The structure of the input streams is learned from the respective specifications of their virtual sensor definitions. 

In GSN data stream processing is separated into three stages:
\begin{itemize}
\item processing applied to sources (lines 26, 33, and 40).
\item processing for combining data from the different input streams and producing the temporary output stream (lines 43-46).
\item producing the final output stream by passing the temporary output stream from a processing class (a processing logic represented in some programming languages). This part is presented by lines 3 -- 10. Note that as the final output is produced by the processing class, the actual output structure of the virtual sensor should strictly
conform the output format of the processing class \footnote{As of \today, the order and the types should be exactly match.}.
\end{itemize}

To specify the processing of the sources we use SQL queries which refer to the actual data source
by the reserved keyword \verb|WRAPPER| (the data sources are logically represented as relational tables all of which are called \verb|wrapper|).
The attribute \verb|wrapper="remote"| indicates that the data stream is obtained through the
network from another virtual sensor which can be located in any other GSN instance accessible through the network.


In the case of a directly connected local sensor, the \verb|wrapper| attribute would reference the required wrapper\footnote{As of \today, all the wrappers have to written in Java language. The actual code for accessing the sensor can be written in any language as long as there is a possibility of communicating the data to the hardware
through Java (e.g., interfacing Java to existing C code or the serial ports).}.
For example, \verb|wrapper="tinyos"| would denote a TinyOS-based sensor whose data
stream is accessed via GSN's TinyOS wrapper \footnote{In GSN, we have multiple TinyOS wrappers each corresponding to different
versions and packet formats. Those details are out of the scope of this chapter.}.
GSN already includes wrappers for all major TinyOS platforms (Mica2, Mica2Dot, etc.), for wired and wireless
(HTTP-based) cameras (e.g., AXIS 206W), several RFID readers (Texas
Instruments, Alien Technology), Bluetooth devices, Shockfish, WiseNodes, epuck
robots, etc. The implementation effort for wrappers is rather low, for example,
the RFID reader wrapper has 50 lines of code (LOC), the TinyOS wrapper has 120
LOC, and the generic serial wrapper has 180 LOC.

In the given example the output stream joins the data received from two
temperature sensors and returns a camera image if certain conditions on the
temperature are satisfied (lines 43--46). To enable the SQL statement in lines
43--46 to produce the output stream, it needs to be able to reference the
required sources which is accomplished by the \verb|name| attribute
(lines 21, 28, and 35) that defines a symbolic name for each stream source.

The definition of the structure of the output stream directly relates to the data
stream processing that is performed by the virtual sensor's processing class and needs to be
consistent with it. GSN provides multiple processing classes each of which are designed
to perform different tasks (e.g., charts, network plots, filtering, ...). In our example we are using
\texttt{gsn.vsensor.BridgeVirtualSensor} as our processing class. The \texttt{gsn.vsensor.BridgeVirtualSensor}
class is special in the sense that unlike most of the other GSN's processing classes, this class does not
perform any further processing on its input stream thus it does not alter the data nor the structure of its input.

Since the structure of the virtual sensor output is not altered through using the \texttt{gsn.vsensor.BridgeVirtualSensor} processing class hence the final
structure of the virtual sensor's output is determined through the SQL statement at line 43, we need to make sure that,
the data fields in the \verb|select| clause matches the definition of the output structure in lines 6--9 (the order is important).
It is recommended to use \texttt{gsn.vsensor.BridgeVirtualSensor} as long as the processing preformed in the virtual
sensor through the SQL queries are sufficient enough and no further processing is required before publishing the sensor 
data to the outside.

In the design of GSN specifications we decided to separate the temporal aspects
from the relational data processing using SQL. The temporal processing is
controlled by various attributes provided in the input and output stream
specifications, e.g., the attribute \verb|storage-size| (lines 21, 28, and 35)
defines the window size used for producing the input stream's data elements.
Due to its specific importance the temporal processing will be discussed in
detail in Section~\ref{sec:data-stre-proc}.

In addition to the specification of the data-related properties a virtual
sensor also includes high-level specifications of functional properties: The
\verb|priority| attribute (line 1) controls the processing priority of a
virtual sensor, the \verb|<life-cycle>| element (line 11) enables the control
and management of resources provided to a virtual sensor such as the maximum
number of threads/queues available for processing, the \verb|<storage>| element
(line 18) allows the user to control how output stream data is persistently
stored.

For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:ComplexVS} the \verb|priority| attribute in
line 1 assigns a priority of 10 to this virtual sensor (1 is the lowest
priority and 20 the highest, default is 10), the \verb|<life-cycle>| element in
line 11 specifies a maximum number of 10 threads, which means that if the pool
size is reached, data will be dropped (if no pool size is specified, it will be
controlled by GSN depending on the current load), the \verb|<storage>| element
in line 18 defines that the output stream's data elements of the last 10 hours
(\verb|history-size| attribute) are stored to enable off-line processing.
The \verb|storage-size| attribute in line 21 defines the window size of 1 stream element. That's the most recent
image taken by the webcam irrespective of the time it was
taken.

In GSN, we can specify the set of values either by time or count. In the count based representation
one only presents the values through integers. For instance \verb|slide='2'| or \verb|history-size='100'|. The count based representation is consists of
an integer directly postfixed (without any space characters) with one of the time measurement units. As of \today, we have \texttt{d},\texttt{h},\texttt{m},\texttt{s} time measurement units which are corresponding to days, hours, minutes and seconds. As a time based example, we might have \verb|storage-size='1m'|.

The \verb|storage-size| attributes in lines 28 and 35 define a window of one minute for the amount of sensor readings subsequent queries
will be run on, i.e., the \verb|AVG| operations in lines 33 and 40 are executed
on the sensor readings received in the last minute which of course depends on
the rate at which the underlying temperature virtual sensor produces its
readings. Note that when the \verb|storage-size| is anything other than \emph{1}, the
virtual sensor author should be aware of the possibility of duplicated stream elements (discussed in more
detail in section \ref{sec:data-stre-proc}).

The query producing the output stream (lines 43--46) also demonstrates another
interesting capability of GSN as it also mediates among three different flavors
of queries: The virtual sensor itself uses continuous queries on the
temperature data, a ``normal'' database query on the camera data and
produces a result only if certain conditions are satisfied, i.e., a
notification analogous to pub/sub or active rules.

Virtual sensors are a powerful abstraction mechanism which enables the user to
declaratively specify sensors and combinations of arbitrary complexity. Virtual
sensors can be defined and deployed to a running GSN instance at any time
without having to stop the system. Also dynamic unloading is supported but
should be used carefully as unloading a virtual sensor may have undesired
(cascading) effects.

\section{Data stream processing and time model}
\label{sec:data-stre-proc}

Data stream processing has received substantial attention in the
recent years in other application domains, such as network monitoring
or telecommunications. As a result, a rich set of query languages and
query processing approaches for data streams exist on which we can
build. A central building block in data stream processing is the time
model as it defines the temporal semantics of data and thus determines
the design and implementation of a system. Currently, most stream
processing systems use a global reference time as the basis for their
temporal semantics because they were designed for centralized
architectures in the first place. As GSN is targeted at enabling a
distributed ``Sensor Internet,'' imposing a specific temporal semantics
seems inadequate and maintaining it might come at unacceptable cost.
GSN provides the essential building blocks for dealing with time, but
leaves temporal semantics largely to applications allowing them to
express and satisfy their specific, largely varying requirements. In
our opinion, this pragmatic approach is viable as it reflects the
requirements and capabilities of sensor network processing.

In GSN a data stream is a set of timestamped tuples also known as Stream Elements.
The order of the data stream is derived from the ordering of the timestamps and GSN
provides basic support for managing and manipulating the timestamps.
The following essential services are provided:

\begin{enumerate}
\item a local clock at each GSN Server
\item implicit management of a timestamp attribute (reserved field called \texttt{TIMED})\footnote{All timestamps in GSN are represented in milliseconds using 64-bit integers.}\footnote{As the timestamp (e.g., the \texttt{TIMED} field) is always present, it is not required to specify the \texttt{TIMED} field in the  \texttt{output-structure} section of the virtual sensors. In fact, specifying the \texttt{TIMED} field in the output structure causes error therefore GSN refuses to load the virtual sensor.}
\item automatic timestamping of tuples upon arrival at the GSN in case the tuples (stream elements) don't have
any timestamp (no \texttt{TIMED} field available)
\item a windowing mechanism which allows the user to define count- or
  time-based windows on data streams.
\item a sliding mechanism which allows the user to define count- or  time-based sliding behaviors on data streams.
\end{enumerate}

In this way it is always possible to trace the temporal history of
data stream elements throughout the processing history.  Multiple time
attributes can be associated with data streams (as long as only one of them called \texttt{TIMED})
and can be manipulated through SQL queries. Thus sensor networks can be used as observation
tools for the physical world, in which network and processing delays
are inherent properties of the observation process which cannot be
made transparent by abstraction.  Let us illustrate this by a simple
example: Assume a bank is being robbed and images of the crime scene
taken by the security cameras are transmitted to the police. For the
insurance company the time at which the images are taken in the bank
will be relevant when processing a claim, whereas for the police
report the time the images arrived at the police station will be
relevant to justify the time of intervention. Depending on the context
the robbery is thus taking place at different times.

As tuples (sensor readings) are timestamped, queries can also deal
explicitly with time. For example, the query in lines 43--46 of
Figure~\ref{fig:ComplexVS} could be extended such that it explicitly
specifies the maximum time interval between the readings of the two
temperatures and the maximum age of the readings. This would
additionally require changes in the source definitions as the
sources then must provide this information (more detailed example below), and also the
averaging of the temperature readings (lines 33 and 40) would have to
be changed to be explicit in respect to the time dimension.

In order to concretely show the time management inside GSN, we would like to
simulate above scenario through two different virtual sensors (only the input stream parts presented).
Say there exist a virtual sensor called \emph{camera-vs} hosted on a GSN server which listens to port \texttt{80} on a machine with IP address of \texttt{1.2.3.4}.
The virtual sensor used by the police and the one used by the insurance are depicted in figures \ref{vs:police} and \ref{vs:insurance}.
The stream specified in figure \ref{vs:police} has a query in line 7 for retrieving both the picture and the time stamp from the remote virtual sensor therefore
the remote timestamp is used by GSN for the internal calculations. Now consider the stream specified in figure \ref{vs:insurance} which has a small change compared to the one in figure \ref{vs:police}, the latter is not selecting the timestamp field hence GSN automatically adds the local reception time to every tuple it receives from the remote source.

In order to further elaborate the time management issue, consider the stream source specified in figure \ref{vs:complex-time}. This example combines both
the local time and remote time in order to measure the latency associated with each tuple and uses the latency as a condition as the selection
criteria (e.g., only accepting the tuples which are not delayed by the network for more than 5 milliseconds).

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{sliding-window-visually}
  \caption{Illustration of the different sample sliding and window values.}
  \label{fig:sliding-window-visually}
\end{figure}

In order to deal with the streaming data, the standard way is to specify
a query with at least two extra properties associated with it,
window size and sliding value. The window size is used to limit
the actual data used for the processing (execution)  to a certain range
in time or number of values. The sliding value is introduced to
specify the execution condition for the query. The execution of the
query is triggered whenever the sliding condition is satisfied implying a possibly infinitely long periodic
execution of the query, therefore in stream processing systems, continuous queries are executed whenever the sliding occurs.

For instance, one can express the interest
of obtaining the average of a temperature sensor over the last $10$
minutes, and doing so periodically every $2$ minutes, by simply
providing the window size of $10$ minutes and sliding value of $2$
minutes to the stream processing engine. As indicated before, each
time the sliding condition is satisfied (e.g., $2$ minutes passed from
the previous execution) the actual action, computing the average over the last $10$
minutes, is performed. Note that in some research papers the
execution of the action is also called \emph{movement of the sliding
window}. 

The temporal processing in GSN is defined using the sliding and window values. Every data source in
GSN can have at most one \verb|slide|\footnote{Default value is 1, therefore this attribute can be omitted}
and \verb|storage-size|\footnote{No default value defined} attributes. Both values can be represented
in the form of count-based or time-based values (described earlier in this section).
Figure \ref{fig:sliding-window-visually} visually represents the query execution inside GSN with different sliding and window values.
We used a black dot in the figure to represent the triggering of execution. For instance, if both the window size and the sliding 
values are 3, and say we have received 5 stream elements in total, our continuous query have been executed only once (at the \emph{Time 3}) during its life time. 
One can extend above paradigm to create virtual sensors to support the integration of continuous and
historical data. For example, if the user wants to be notified when the temperature is 10 degrees above the average temperature in the
last 24 hours, he/she can simply define two sources, getting data from the same wrapper but with different window sizes, i.e., 1
(count) and 24h (time), and then simply write a query specifying the original condition with these sources.


The production of a new output stream element of a virtual sensor is always triggered
by the arrival of a data stream element from one of its input streams, thus processing is event-driven.
As described before, a stream can have multiple sources. 
Once the window of one of the sources of a stream slides, the 
following processing steps are performed:

\begin{enumerate}
%\item By default the new data stream element is timestamped using the local
%  clock of the virtual sensor provided that the stream element had no
%  timestamp.
\item Based on the timestamps for each stream the stream elements are
  selected according to the definition of the time window and the resulting
  sets of relations are unnested into flat relations.
\item The queries defined on the source are evaluated and stored into temporary
  relations.
\item The stream query for producing the input of the processing class is executed
  based on the temporary relations.
\item The resulted stream elements are forwarded to the processing class.
\item The output of the processing class is stored and simultaneously forwarded (notification) to
 all consumers of the virtual sensor.
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:ConceptualDataFlow} shows the logical data flow inside
a GSN node.

\begin{figure}%[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{conceptual-dataflow}
  \caption{Conceptual data flow in a GSN node}
  \label{fig:ConceptualDataFlow}
\end{figure}

Additionally, GSN provides a number of attributes in the virtual sensor file to control data rates.

At the source level by providing the \texttt{sampling-rate} attribute to allow the dropping of stream elements with some random probability for load shedding.
The values used for \texttt{sampling-rate} are float numbers between 0 to 1.
For instance, if one has a temperature source that keeps producing 
data with very high rate, one might want to sample the produced values 
thus making the processing lighter. For instance if one sets the 
sampling-rate to 0.75, any received stream element from the wrapper is going to be 
included in the window (the window and sliding values are explained above) with a probability of 75 out of 100.
Thus, on average 25 random stream elements will be dropped out of the last 100 elements.
In most of the cases one typically sets the rate control attributes to "1" to make sure nothing is dropped.

Two other rate controls that function in a different manner are:
\begin{itemize}
\item At the stream level by providing \texttt{rate} attribute (integer value above zero).
\item At the virtual sensor output level by providing \texttt{output-specification} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{rate} attribute (integer value above zero).
\end{itemize}

The rate control is a positive integer, and defines the minimum allowed time difference between two successive stream elements.
For instance, if one is interested in receiving an average of a given sensor once an hour but the sensor underneath can produce arbitrary number of stream elements 
(e.g., due to uncontrollable packet losses in the internal network), he can express this behavior by setting the rate attribute of the virtual sensor output 
(\texttt{output-specification} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{rate}) to ``3600000'' (one hour is 3,600,000 milliseconds).


Refer to the virtual sensor quick reference for the syntactical
information about different portions of the virtual sensor file.

\begin{comment} %probably not needed in this context
To specify the data stream processing a suitable language is needed. A number
of proposals exist already, so we compare the language approach of GSN to the
major proposals from the literature. In the Aurora project~\cite{Cherniack03}
(\url{http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/aurora/}) users can compose stream
relationships and construct queries in a graphical representation which is then
used as input for the query planner.  The Continuous Query Language (CQL)
suggested by the STREAM project~\cite{Arasu06}
(\url{http://www-db.stanford.edu/stream/}) extends standard SQL syntax with new
constructs for temporal semantics and defines a mapping between streams and
relations. Similarly, in Cougar~\cite{Yao03}
(\url{http://www.cs.cornell.edu/database/cougar/}) an extended version of SQL
is used, modeling temporal characteristics in the language itself. The
StreaQuel language suggested by the TelegraphCQ project~\cite{Chandrasekaran03}
(\url{http://telegraph.cs.berkeley.edu/}) follows a different path and tries to
isolate temporal semantics from the query language through external definitions
in a C-like syntax. For example, for specifying a sliding window for a query a
\textit{for}-loop is used. The actual query is then formulated in an SQL-like
syntax.

GSN's approach is related to TelegraphCQ's as it separates the
time-related constructs from the actual query. Temporal
specifications, e.g., the window size and rates, are specified in XML in the
virtual sensor specification, while data processing is specified in
SQL. Using this design, GSN can support SQL queries with the full range of
operations allowed by the standard SQL syntax \footnote{As of \today, GSN does not support the following standard SQL keywords: Group-By, Limit, Top and Offset.}

, i.e., joins,
sub-queries, ordering, grouping, unions, intersections, etc.
The advantage of using SQL is that it is well-known and SQL query
optimization and planning techniques can be directly applied.

\section{GSN to GSN communication Protocol}
In this section we would like to present the the low level details of GSN to GSN communication protocol.
In order to enable data sharing and distributed collaborative data stream processing, we have introduced
two special type of wrappers in GSN. First, the \texttt{local} wrapper, which enables data stream sharing
among virtual sensors on the same machine. Second, the \texttt{remote} wrapper, which enables data stream
sharing among multiple distributed virtual sensors each of which located on different machine accessible through the network.

\subsection{\texttt{remote} wrapper}

In GSN whenever a virtual sensor wants to use another virtual sensor located on a different GSN server, the 
communication between two GSN servers is triggered (during the loading process of the local virtual sensor).
Once GSN notices that a remote virtual sensor is required by 
a local virtual sensor, GSN temporary suspends the local virtual sensor's loading process to confirm the existence of the remote virtual
sensor. Therefore, GSN to GSN communication is initiated whenever a virtual sensor in a node $A$ wants to use the data stream
provided by another virtual sensor in a node $B$ ($A \neq B$).

Using this kind of architecture, GSN mediates all the outgoing and incoming connections therefore the local virtual sensor
does not interact directly with the remote virtual sensor (and vise versa). The packets exchanged between
two GSN servers during GSN to GSN communication is depicted in figure \ref{fig:gsn-network-firewall} (all communications
are implemented using XML-RPC calls). In the following we provide a brief description of each packet:
\begin{description}
	\item[structure-request/structure] is used by the local GSN server to discover the output structure of the remote virtual sensor. The response
	to this packet, confirms the existence and availability of the remote virtual sensor and contains the details of the  output-structure of the remote virtual
	sensor.	
	\item[register/confirm] is used by the local GSN server to send the query and the contact address of the stream consumer. The query will be added to the notification
	list associated with the prospective virtual sensor at the stream producer, therefore whenever the remote virtual sensor produces a stream element, the query
	will be evaluated and the output of the evaluation(in case it is not empty) is delivered to the stream consumer.
	The remote virtual sensor uses the addressing information (received in the registration packet) to contact the stream consumer in order to
	deliver the stream elements. As there might be multiple virtual sensors at the stream consumer side be interested in one virtual sensor hosted
	at the stream producer, any register request has a UUID associated with it which is used by the stream producer whenever it wants to deliver stream elements 
	to the stream consumer.
	\item[data] represents the stream of tuples which are going to be delivered to the stream consumer. At the stream consumer, GSN server receives the data and based
	on the UUID of the tuples, GSN server disseminates the tuples to the appropriate local virtual sensors.
\end{description}

\begin{figure}%[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{gsn-network-firewall}
  \caption{Experimental setup}
  \label{fig:gsn-network-firewall}
\end{figure}

In order to make the GSN to GSN communication more concrete, we provide more system level details below.
For using a remote virtual sensor, the first step is locating the \emph{contact point} of the GSN server which
hosts the prospective virtual sensor. By default, the contact point is \texttt{http://ip-address:gsn-port/gsn-handler}\footnote{The GSN port is specified in the \texttt{conf/gsn.xml} file and will be 22001 unless changed.}\footnote{In the \texttt{webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml} file, the GSN's RPC handler (the \texttt{gsn.GSNRPC} class) is mapped to \texttt{/gsn-handler}. One shouldn't confuse the \texttt{/gsn-handler} with \texttt{/gsn} which is designed to be used solely by the web/ajax interface and does not involved in XML-RPC calls.}.
If  the contact point is correctly identified, the response to a plain HTTP POST request 
returns a XML output.\footnote{The actual output represents an error as the request is not properly formatted.}\footnote{For sending plain HTTP POST requests
to \texttt{http://ip-address:gsn-port/gsn-handler}, you may want to use \url{http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/}. }

Correct identification of the contact point is crucial in success of using the remote virtual sensor.
Once the contact points identified successfully, one can define a stream which consume data from the other data source.
Note that consuming data from a remote virtual sensor doesn't require any kind of modifications at the remote host and in fact 
due to GSN's decoupled architecture, the remote virtual sensor is not even aware of its data consumers. In figure \ref{gsn2gsn-simple-figure},
the virtual sensor \texttt{ConsumerVS} running at the GSN server with the IP address of \texttt{3.3.3.3} under the port \texttt{22001} is interested
in getting data from the \texttt{CoolVS} running at the GSN server with the IP address of \texttt{4.4.4.4} under the port \texttt{22001}. To enable this
communication one has to use a source configuration similar to the one in figure \ref{gsn2gsn-simple-figure}.


\begin{figure}%[htb]

In some deployments, GSN servers are hosted behind a NAT an apache web server\footnote{The instruction for using GSN behind a apache web server is provided in appendix \todo{ref{app:gsn-apache}}.} which can cause port and/or IP change. This can be true for both the GSN data stream consumer and GSN data stream producer.
In these cases, one can use the more advanced form of the remote wrapper. Figure \ref{gsn2gsn-nat-figure} presents a sample setup in which both of the GSN data stream
consumer and data producer are behind firewall. The firewall at the consumer side has mapped \texttt{3.3.3.3:22001} into \texttt{1.1.1.1:82} and at the stream producer side
firewall has mapped \texttt{4.4.4.4:22001} into \texttt{2.2.2.2:80}.  To enable this kind of
communication one has to use a source configuration similar to the one in figure \ref{gsn2gsn-nat-figure}.

\subsection{\texttt{local} wrapper}
The \verb|local| wrapper is special version of \texttt{remote} wrapper (host = ``\texttt{127.0.0.1}'') which is optimized
for communication among two different virtual sensors inside the same GSN server. By having the
\texttt{local} wrapper optimized, we imply that most of the overhead associated with TCP/IP networking
calls are eliminated by using internal GSN calls instead. The \texttt{local} wrapper is recommend whenever
the end to end delay between two virtual sensors is important. In GSN, we have implemented the 
notification system so that the GSN server always gives priority to the local virtual sensors when it wans to disseminate
the stream elements thus the local virtual sensors usually get notified earlier.


\section{GSN Notifications}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

In GSN, virtual sensors can be configured to notify users of certain events, e.g. to send an Email notification to an user informing them that a particular event has occurred. To implement notifications in GSN is very straight forward. The basic principle is that once the virtual sensor query is answered as specified in the virtual sensor description file, e.g.

\begin{xmlcode}
<query>SELECT temperature FROM s1 WHERE temperature >= 100</query>
\end{xmlcode}

a notification can be triggered  by the java processing class

\begin{xmlcode}
<class-name>gsn.vsensor.EmailVirtualSensor</class-name>
\end{xmlcode}

see examples in next section. Thus, any type of notifications, e.g. Email, SMS, SIP, Fax, MMS can be implemented easily in a virtual sensor processing class. 

The technical details of implementing notifications are left to the designer. Below are three examples of some of the notification services already implemented in GSN.

\section{Notes}


\subsubsection{Where is the DTD for the virtual sensor?}
We are using JiBX Java-XML binding project. The structure of the virtual sensor descriptor file is defined in \texttt{conf/VirtualSensorDescription.xml}.

Have a look to the \chapref{quickref_vsd_dtd}.

\subsubsection{Which databases we support ?}
At the moment we are supporting HSqlDB and MySQL. Checkout the mailing list for the latest issues regarding the other databases and their
support status.
\subsubsection{Which projects are using GSN ?}
There are over 10 EU/Swiss funding research projects using GSN as their core technology.
\subsubsection{GSN.XML file}
\subsection{GeoRSS}
\subsection{Network communication}
Looking inside the GSN infrastructure, there are at least half a dozen difference network communication channels are used. In this section I would like to dive in to the details
of the some major communication protocols designed and implemented in GSN. 

\subsubsection{Reusing Data Streams}

One of the main ideas behind the virtual sensors is resuability. The resuability comes in two forms.
First being able to recreate the same processing logic on different data streams.
Second being able to reuse streaming data produced by other parties over the internet and possibly create a new data stream but instrumenting the original streams.
In this section, I present the both high level and low level details associated with the second aspect of the reusability.

The virtual sensor descriptor file is the first place which specifies the intention of reusing streaming data from another virtual sensor. The source virtual sensor can be located
anywhere as long as it is accessible through the network, this ofcourse includes the local machine and any other machine on the Internet. 


In GSN, our vision is having an internet scale streaming world in which people can publish streaming data which
can be produced directly using some sort of a measurement device which can range from a physical wireless sensor to stock ticks from a financial market.
