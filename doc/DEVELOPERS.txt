Checking out the code 
=====================

GSN code is publicly available from the sourceforge
subversion repository server.

You can check out GSN as an eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org)
project by using the subclipse plugin (http://subclipse.tigris.org).

Or with the following command-line:

svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/globalsn globalsn
 

Installing dependencies
=======================
Due to licensing terms, GSN cannot provide you the JMF
library (Java Media Framework). However, this library is
needed to compile GSN.

You can download it from

http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/download.html

Simply put the JMF-2.1.1.e folder in the folder containing the
src, conf, doc, icons, jars... folders.

You will also need the ant building tool (http://ant.apache.org/)
and the latest version of the JDK (at least JDK1.5 update 6, see
http://java.sun.com ).

Using the build system
======================

go to the folder containing gsn. There, run 

ant build

It should tell you that it compiles many files and show a success
message.

To test the build, run

ant gui

That's all !

There are various other ant targets:

test    runs unit tests for gsn.
jar		builds a jar library containing gsn.

Enabling the SSL support
========================
If you want to use SSL for transmitting and/or receiving data from
a virtual sensor, you need to Generate  Keys and Certificates : 

  # The following command will generate a key pair and certificate directly into
    a keystore (note that the keystore file name MUST be stored in conf/gsn.jks)
   cd conf
   keytool -keystore gsn.jks -alias gsn -genkey -keyalg RS
