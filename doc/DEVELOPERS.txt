Licensing terms
===============
GSN is licensed under the GNU GPL license, version 2. A complete copy
of the text can be found in the file GPL-2.txt.
Basically, it grants you the rights to use, redistribute and modify
GSN. However, if you want to redistribute a modified version of GSN,
you must provide the complete source code of your modifications. 
In case of doubt, please refer to the file GPL-2.txt.

Checking out the code 
=====================

GSN code is publicly available from the sourceforge
subversion repository server.

You can check out GSN as an eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org)
project by using the subclipse plugin (http://subclipse.tigris.org).

Or with the following command-line:

svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gsn gsn
 

Installing dependencies
=======================
Due to licensing terms, GSN cannot provide you the JMF
library (Java Media Framework). However, this library is
needed to compile GSN.

You can download it from

http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/download.html

Simply put the JMF-2.1.1.e folder in the folder containing the
src, conf, doc, icons, jars... folders.

You will also need the ant building tool (http://ant.apache.org/)
and the latest version of the JDK (at least JDK1.5 update 6, see
http://java.sun.com ).

Using the build system
======================

go to the folder containing gsn. There, run 

ant build

It should tell you that it compiles many files and show a success
message.

To test the build, run

ant gui

That's all !

There are various other ant targets:

test    runs unit tests for gsn.
jar		builds a jar library containing gsn.

Enabling the SSL support
========================
If you want to use SSL for transmitting and/or receiving data from
a virtual sensor, you need to Generate  Keys and Certificates : 

  # The following command will generate a key pair and certificate directly into
    a keystore (note that the keystore file name MUST be stored in conf/gsn.jks)
   cd conf
   keytool -keystore gsn.jks -alias gsn -genkey -keyalg RS

Running the webapp in apache
========================
If you want to run the webapp in apache, you will need to redirect the servlet to it. 

Enable the following modules in httpd.conf :
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so

Add in the DocumentRoot directory part (<Directory "..."></Directory>) in httpd.conf or
in a .htaccess file at the root, the following rules:
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^(gsn-handler|gsn|field|data|upload)(|\?(.*))$ http://localhost:22001/$0 [P]
