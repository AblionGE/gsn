GSN Change logs
---------------

r1.0.1
Added the 'ScriptletProcessor' processing class which can be used to implement arbitrary complex processing class by specifying its logic in the Groovy language, directly in the virtual sensor description file.
Added pagination support for MySQL (/data and /multidata servlet and DataDistributer) which enable GSN to stream an arbitrary large amount of data.
Fixed OutOfMemory errors due to large amount of data requests.
Fixed OutOfMemory errors due to a dbcp library memory leak when calling multiple time the getMetadata (This is going to be fixed in the dbcp 1.4.1).
Fixed GSN hang forever due to a database connection leak in the (/data and /multidata servlets).
Fixed synchronization bug related to jetty Continuation, in the remote-rest wrapper.
Fixed reconnection bug in the remote-rest and remote-push wrappers.
Fixed the org.apache.commons.dbcp.DelegatingPreparedStatement is closed Exception.
Fixed exceptions thrown (such as: java.lang.NumberFormatException: multiple points) due to concurrent access to the /multidata servlet.
Integrated the GSN installer in the trunk through the 'installer' ant task.
Added the 'download_mode=inline' parameter to the /multidata servlet, in order to get the data not as an attachment.
Removed the unused virtual-sensor pool, marked the 'lifeCyclePool' configuration element as deprecated.
